## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution

If you notice a problem with the code that you believe needs improvement but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of the content and/or screenshots if applicable. Curriculum owners regularly review issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

- Fork this curriculum repository
- Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
- Open a Pull Request against this repo
- The code owner will review your change and approve or comment on it in due course.
